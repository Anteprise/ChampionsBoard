This website aims to put our champion sportsman up in lights and to allow sports fans to vote on their all time favourite sportsman.

Notes:

    If you select a sport and then a sportsman, the random champions board display will stop, and your chosen sportsman will appear on the board.
    Your selection will display some video of your champion as well as his achievements.

    If the champions board is randomly displaying champions and you click on Sign Up, vote or Leader Board the random display will stop. It will restart when you close said windows.

    If you click on the blog post button, it will display the post form. This form will not shut, unless you fill it out properly and click "Post comment", or you click on the above links or refresh your page.

    The champions achievement table only displays the most notable achievements of your champion. All champions on this board have achieved so much more.

    The producer of this site has only randomly picked out 9 notable sportsman. No research has been done on who are truly the best. In future it will include all men and women champion sports people from all major sports that are played around the world.

    The footer links are not functional. They just display a message stating that these documents will be included in the future.

    Apoligies to the lady's. If I did this site for real it would include champion women sports-lady's as well.
